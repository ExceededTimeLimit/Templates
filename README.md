3rd - Style Sheet css
```

*All the templates have been distributed in different categories and the screenshots of their working can be found in their respective parent directorie's readme and in the sub directory itself*

## How to work with the template?
You just need to clone folder of the component you want to use and can use scss or the css file for styling both will produce the same results.
